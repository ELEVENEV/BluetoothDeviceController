The Slant Robotics LittleBot was a 3D-printed robot kit launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slantrobotics/littlebot-a-fun-arduino-robot-for-students-and-beg). The robot
is powered by an Arduino Nano that drives the wheels, controls the optional gripper arm, and runs the ultrasonic 
distance sensor (this is the "eyes"). Being an Arduino, the device Bluetooth connection is via a standard
HC-06 type Bluetooth serial port (not Bluetooth LE); in order to run the device you'll need to switch to 
Bluetooth Comm port mode.

Macros are provided to easily control the robot (or you can type in the values manually).
