The Reality Robotics BERO (Be the Robot) was a kickstarter fully-assembled robot launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/realityrobotics/be-the-robot-bero-bluetooth-controlled-open-source). Unlike
some other Kickstarter robots, this one is a fully-formed robot; you don't have to assemble it. It's also
got a more sophisticated set of commands, including the capability of playing sounds that you add
to the little SD card.

The Bluetooth connection is via a Bluetooth serial port. To connect to a BERO, first make sure you are paired.
Then run the program, selecting the Bluetooth COMM port as the set of devices to find. When you find the SerialPort
device, it might be your robot. If it is, then set the Preferred Macro Set to BERO.

Set the screen to show three buttons wide; this results in the best set of controls. There are sliders for the arms 
and the head. You can set exactly values for the two drive motors (marked Left and Right) and the LED eyes and the 
light-up headphones. The lights take a value from 0 to 9 where 0 is off and 9 is the maximum brightness.
