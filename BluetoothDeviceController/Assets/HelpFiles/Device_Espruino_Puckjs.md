# The Espruino Puckjs Programmable Bluetooth Beacon

![Button](../DevicePictures/Espruino_Puckjs-175.png)

The Espruino Puckjs "JavaScript powered button you can program and debug wireless" was a kickstarter 
button launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gfw/puckjs-the-ground-breaking-bluetooth-beacon/). 
It's claim to fame is that it's a tiny little device that's fully programmable in JavaScript 
but the always-awesome Espruino people. It's got a small compliment of sensors, but the amazing
capability is that you can download and run JavaScript programs. 

The Bluetooth connection is via the Nordic Semiconductor NRF system; the device 
is Bluetooth LE, but it includes a service with a transmit and receive characteristics; 
these are used to send JavaScript commands to the device. The device specialization 
looks just like a terminal because that's what the device emulated.

Unlike the Smartibot robot, which requires a confusing change to the *require* statement,
the Puckjs beacon can be out of the box with no special configuration.
