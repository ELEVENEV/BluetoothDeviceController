![Mipow Playbulb](../DevicePictures/Mipow_Playbulb_BTL201-175.png)

The Mipow Playbulb is a smart Bluetooth-enabled LED light. There are 
several varieties; this program was tested with the BTL201 type but others may work.

The Playbulb includes a nice Candle effect; it shows up best when you have the bulb in a proper lamp with a real shade (and no, I don't know why the shade makes such a difference).

When you go to the Demo page, the color of some of the demo values (like the Blink demo) depend on the color you pick in the Color page.
