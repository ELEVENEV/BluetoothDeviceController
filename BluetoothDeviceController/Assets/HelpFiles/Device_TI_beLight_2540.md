The TI beLight kit was created for TI to demonstrate the high-temperature capabilities
of their microcontrollers. The kit is a small round PCB; powering it in will turn on 
the light to a default setting. There are four LEDs mounted: one each of red, green, blue,
and white. The white is the brightest.
