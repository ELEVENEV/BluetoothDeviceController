# Nordic Thingy device

![Nordic Thingy](../DevicePictures/Nordic_Thingy-175.png)

I think the Nordic Thingy is one of my absolute favorite Bluetooth data devices. It has a large
rechargable battery so it works for a long time, and it connects very easily. It includes some
environmental sensors for CO2 and volatile organic chemicals that most other devices do not include.

# Example

In this example I'm loking at the data from the light (Color RGB+Clear) sensor. This
sensor goes beyong the normal overall light (LUX) sensor. This sensor also includes a red,
green, and blue sensor: you can look at data over a day and see how the light changes from 
very redish in the morning to a more white color in the middle of the day.
