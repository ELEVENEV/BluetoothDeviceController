# Kano coding wand

[Kano Wand](https://kano.me/store/us/products/coding-wand) in the kano.me store.

The flks at Kano have created a really nifty little device: it's wand with a small Bluetooth sensor package
that reports on the position of a small button plus accelerometers, temperatures and gyroscopes. I learned
about it at work; a link to the wand was passed around. Since I like fiddling with Bluetooth devices, I got
one (and better, it was on sale).

The Kano Wand specialization here is just for fun: you can wave the wand around and see what the resulting
data looks like. You can see when the button is pressed, and you can control the wand's vibration mode.

# Pairing and usage information

The wand does not need to be paired. It is one of the more finicky devices; sometimes you have to try and
retry to get it connected properly.
